AI-powered Network Intrusion Detection System using Machine Learning
This project is a Machine Learning–based Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) that detects malicious network traffic using the Random Forest algorithm.  
It provides a real-time interactive dashboard built with Streamlit for monitoring and analysis.

** Problem Statement **
<br>
Cyberattacks like DDoS, port scanning, and unauthorized intrusions strike every 39 seconds, costing businesses $4.35 million per breach. Traditional signature-based security systems can't detect new or evolving threats in real-time, leaving networks vulnerable to zero-day attacks. This project develops an intelligent Machine Learning-based intrusion detection system that learns attack patterns dynamically and accurately classifies network traffic as benign or malicious. Unlike legacy systems that react after damage occurs, our solution provides proactive, real-time threat prevention.

** Features **
- Real-time network traffic analysis
- Machine Learning–based attack detection
- Random Forest classification algorithm
- Interactive Streamlit dashboard
- Live traffic simulation
- Performance evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix

** Technologies Used **
- Python
- Machine Learning (Random Forest Classifier)
- Streamlit (Dashboard)
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Visual Studio Code

** Project Workflow **
1. Data generation or loading (simulated network traffic)
2. Data preprocessing and feature selection
3. Train-test split
4. Model training using Random Forest
5. Performance evaluation
6. Live traffic input and prediction
7. Visualization through Streamlit dashboard
